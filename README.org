#+title: My Configuration

This is my configuration. To be honest it's centered around [[file:emacs/README.org][Emacs]],
with smatterings of other stuff.

* Install Homebrew & packages

#+begin_src sh
which brew || /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew bundle
#+end_src

* Tangle other config files

Execute this next block of source code to tangle the main config
files after checking out.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(require 'ob-tangle)
(dolist (org-file (directory-files-recursively "." ".+\\.org"))
  (when (file-exists-p org-file)
    (org-babel-tangle-file org-file)))
#+end_src
