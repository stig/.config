#+title: Zsh setup

I mainly use Emacs' Eshell, but when I do find myself in Zsh I don't
want to be without these aliases.

#+begin_src sh :tangle ~/.zshrc
alias dc=docker-compose
alias dcl='docker-compose logs --follow --tail 10'
alias dcu=docker-compose up -d
alias ff=emacsclient
alias dps="docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}'"
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh :tangle ~/.zshenv
export EDITOR=emacsclient

# Emacs can't find pdflatex without this, for some reason. This
# *should* be handled by system setup, but I don't have time to debug
# why it's not working at the moment. I hope to look into it again
# after the upgrade to Big Sur.
