#+title: Restic
#+subtitle: Backups--I have them?

I use Restic to back up to an S3 bucket. I don't want to have to run
it manually, so I use a LaunchAgent to schedule backups regularly.

I configure the LaunchAgent using [[file:Nix.org][Nix]].

: security add-generic-password -a s3.amazonaws.com/brautaset-backups -D 'restic backup password' -s restic -w
