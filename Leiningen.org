#+title: Leiningen

I want to use some lein plugins across all projects.

We use ~:pedantic? true~ in our project.clj files, as well as lein
sub-project inheritance.  I think that plays merry hell with also
loading ~refactor-nrepl~ (lots of complaints about duplications), so
I add the ~:pedantic? :ranges~.  Not sure why it works, but it
seems to.

#+begin_src clojure :mkdirp t :tangle ~/.lein/profiles.clj
{:user {:plugins [[circleci/deps-plus "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]]
        :pedantic? :ranges}
 :repl {:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.25.2"]
                  [refactor-nrepl "2.5.0"]]}}
#+end_src
