#+title: Nix Configuration

I'm making another attempt at learning Nix, as it seems incredibly
useful for managing my environment for different projects.

I'm using [[https://blog.sulami.xyz/posts/nix-for-developers/][Robin Schroer's blog post]] and [[https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-learn-nix/][Ian Henry's stream of
conciousness]] as my guides. I'll probably check out the manual too, one
day.
