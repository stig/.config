Stig's Emacs Config
===================

This is my emacs configuration. There are many like it, but this one
is mine.

After many ears I'm finally learning Lisp. (Well, Clojure.) Lisp and
Emacs go hand in hand, so I decided to learn Emacs in the process. I'm
starting from the "better defaults" package and adding things
one-by-one as I find them, rather than stealing someone else's mammoth
.emacs file that I don't understand any of.

Initially i drew a lot of inspiration from https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d
-- though after rewriting it to use https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package
(which is excellent) it is starting to feel like my own work.
